# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Attacks — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on understanding patterns in cybersecurity attack data using a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach.
It helps uncover trends, attack types, severity levels, and behavioral insights using Python visualizations.

---

## 📌 Why This Project?

Cybersecurity datasets often contain large, complex logs that are difficult to interpret directly.
This project aims to simplify that complexity by analyzing the dataset visually and statistically — making it easier to understand attack trends and network behavior.

## 📊 What This Project Includes

### **1. Jupyter Notebook EDA (`cyber_attacks_eda.ipynb`)**

The notebook walks through:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Understanding dataset columns
* Attack type distributions
* Severity-level analysis
* Trend and time-based exploration
* Visualizations using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
* Key insights and observations

### **2. Dashboard Screenshots (`Dashboard_Screenshots/`)**

Although a full Streamlit app is not included, the project contains screenshots showing how the dashboard could look.
These highlight:

* Hourly attack patterns
* Attack frequency
* Severity breakdown
* Category-wise summaries

### **3. Dataset (`cybersecurity_attacks.csv`)**

The raw dataset used for the analysis.
